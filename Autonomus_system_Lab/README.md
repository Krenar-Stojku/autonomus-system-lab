#  Autonomous Systems A Lab â€“ Truck Platooning Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the *Autonomous Systems A Lab* course at Hochschule Hamm-Lippstadt. The aim is to analyze and simulate truck platooning behaviors using modeling languages (UML, SysML) and verification tools like UPPAAL.

Each group member addresses a unique scenario. This repository contains the work for:

> *Scenario: Human Driver Override of One Truck*

---

##  Group Members
- Krenar Stojku â€“ Scenario :Human Driver Override

##  Scenario: Human Driver Override

###  Description
A truck in the platoon is manually overridden by a human driver, requiring safe detachment and autonomous reconfiguration of the platoon. This scenario ensures robustness when autonomy is interrupted.

###  Objectives
- Detect driver override reliably.
- Notify all platoon members of override status.
- Ensure safe disengagement of the overridden truck.
- Reconfigure remaining trucks to maintain platoon integrity.

##  Technologies Used
- *PlantUML* â€“ for UML/SysML diagrams
- *Markdown* â€“ for structured documentation
- *GitHub* â€“ for version control and group collaboration
- (Later) UPPAAL, Python, CARLA, OpenCV, Scikit-learn
